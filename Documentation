# Create an API (Node.js) where we stablish connection into LocalHost and request data


1 - Create Server and open port with express

2 - Stablish express.static and the folder we want to use

# RestFull API:
- http://flowersapi.com/about/

Words between slashes doesn't have to mean directories, they can mean routes

- flowerapi.com/search/sunflower/

Manage and set up routes

3 - Manage get Requests (app.get('route', 'function'))

# addWord - (Need to make it persistance) adds the specified word on URL on our Dict
# sendAll - sends the words variable
# searchWord - looks for the specified word and it responses if it founded or not.

4 - Persistance 

# Import file with fs library, data = fs.readFileSync('words.json');
# Parse raw data, wordsDict = JSON.parse(data)
# Add new word and price into wordsDict, wordsDict[word] = price;
# Parse wordDicts into JSON, JSON.stringfy(wordsDict, null, 2)
# Export data into JSON file, fs.writeFile('words.json', wordsDict, callback(err){});


5 - Frond End Client

#  Import p5.js on website
#  Load JSON data from JSON file stored in /All, loadJSON('/all', gotData);
#  Submit input text in index.html to wods.json via sketch.js, submitWord();
#  Add submited text via loadJSON('add/' + word + '/' + price, function finished(data){});


6 - Using POST request

# POST security is to hide data, security
# POST to media, upload large data...
# index.html analyze will include POST request, same with analyzeThis on sketch.js and server.js
# need to parse POST data to extract the fields we want, (body-parser)
# parse app with urlencoded, parse app/json
